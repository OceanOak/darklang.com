## Notice

We're winding down the publicly-hosted instance of Dark-Classic.

## Start the Tailwind CLI build process

To build and watch the CSS, use the following command:
`npm run dev`

After that, you'll need to host the static assets with a server. We typically use the VS Code "Live Server" extension.

## Formatting

To format, use VSCode Prettier extension, or run:
`npx prettier --write .`

To check it: `npx prettier --check .`

Formatting is checked in CI
