## Current Status

We've set up a basic React website with the following features:

1. **React with TypeScript** - For type-safe development
2. **Vite** - For fast development experience
3. **React Router** - For navigation between pages
4. **Tailwind CSS** - For styling components

The website is now running with basic functionality:
- Navigation between Home and About pages works correctly
- The layout structure with header and footer is in place
- Basic content is displayed on each page

## Recent Updates

1. **Removed PostCSS** - Simplified the build process by removing PostCSS dependency
2. **Cleaned up unnecessary files** - Removed unused files:
   - Removed `src/App.css` as it wasn't being imported anywhere
   - Removed `src/assets/react.svg` as it wasn't being used

## Next Steps

1. Enhance the UI with more Tailwind CSS styling
2. Add more UI components as needed
3. Implement state management if required
4. Add form handling capabilities
5. Implement data fetching from APIs
