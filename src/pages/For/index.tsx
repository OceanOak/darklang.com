I'm thinking to have a bunch of pages like
darklang.com/for/web-developers
with dedicated content for groups of folks who we think might appreciate Darklang.

here are some ideas

darklang.com/for/fsharp-developers
darklang.com/for/home-automation
darklang.com/for/eInk-devices
darklang.com/for/web-developers
darklang.com/for/people-with-money (letter asking them to invest etc?)
darklang.com/for/people-who-want-money (entrepreneurs? scripters? people with servers?)
darklang.com/for/security-nerds
darklang.com/for/unix-users
darklang.com/for/accessibility
darklang.com/for/AI-developers
darklang.com/for/lazy-people
darklang.com/for/folks-who-collect-domains
darklang.com/for/python-developers
darklang.com/for/web-scrapers (the web is ridden with flies, you can hardly see through. scrape the web and provide) also good for folks who are into those browser extensions... something monkey? that remove ads and such
darklang.com/for/privacy
darklang.com/for/local-first
darklang.com/for/small-businesses (SSG; wordpress alt.; affordable software solutions and contracting)




in each of these, include expandable section for context for those outside the know

  );
};

export default For;
